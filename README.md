## 🧠 What Is This?

This repository documents my ongoing experiment:

> Can a real developer assistant run reliably on ultra-low-end hardware?

No GPU.  
No Mac Mini.  
No cloud cluster.  

Just a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W (512MB RAM) and NanoBot.

---

## 🚀 The Goal

- Test practical developer workflows on edge hardware  
- Measure performance under real constraints  
- Explore decentralized, low-cost AI infrastructure  
- Push a 512MB board to its limits  

---

## ⚡ Current Status

- NanoBot installed via `uv`
- Running on Raspberry Pi Zero 2W
- ~0.5s CLI response time
- Stable under light workloads

Full setup + details → see **Week 0 documentation**

---

## 📅 This Is a Weekly Experiment

Each update will include:

- Real testing scenarios  
- Performance logs  
- Limitations discovered  
- Improvements made  

Tiny hardware.  
Serious experimentation.

---

### TL;DR

Edge AI shouldn’t require expensive machines.  
Let’s see how far we can push ₹1,500 hardware.
